Library app to store locally basic information about books.

Main objective in this project is to create and app where user will be able to store locally basic information regarding books. 
To add a book they will have to fill in few information about them and submit it.
Once submitted, book will display on the screen with ability to toggle/change read status. Also there will be ability to remove a book. 

As per The Odin Project specification on this assignment/project:
"Youâ€™re not required to add any type of storage right now to save the information between page reloads. You will have the option to come back to this project later on in the course." 
In a further I shall come back to this project and add such feature of data storage.
